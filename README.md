<h1>⏳ The Tail End Visualizer</h1>

<h2>Why This Exists</h2>

<p>Most of us drift through life thinking there’s <em>always</em> more time:  
More Sundays. More trips. More dinners with family. More lazy afternoons with friends.</p>

<p>But when you break your life down into weeks just tiny dots on a grid you see the truth:  
<strong>Your time is heartbreakingly finite.</strong></p>

<p>This visualizer is a wake-up call.  
A simple, powerful way to see how many weeks you’ve already spent — and how few you have left.</p>

<p>It’s not meant to scare you.  
It’s meant to <em>shake you awake</em> — to help you spend your remaining time with purpose, love, and intention.</p>

<h2> What It Does</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Input your date of birth</strong> — and optionally, your target lifespan (like 90 years).</li>
  <li><strong>See your life in weeks</strong> — every dot is one week.</li>
  <li><strong>Visualize how many weeks you’ve lived</strong> — and how many remain.</li>
  <li>❤️ <strong>Let it hit you</strong> — and use that feeling to spend your time on what truly matters.</li>
</ul>

<h2>✨ Why It Hits Hard</h2>

<p>When Tim Urban shared <em>The Tail End</em>, millions realized that they’d already spent most of their in-person time with parents, siblings, or childhood friends.  
It’s the moment you see your life, not as an endless road, but as a handful of precious Sundays, summers, hugs, books, or sunsets.</p>

<p>The Tail End Visualizer is a gentle nudge to put your phone down, call your mom, plan that trip, or just sit with someone you love fully there, fully alive.</p>

<h2>✅ How to Use It</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Open the visualizer.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Enter your date of birth</strong> (and your target lifespan if you’d like).</li>
  <li><strong>See your grid of weeks.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Reflect. Breathe. Choose wisely.</strong></li>
</ol>
